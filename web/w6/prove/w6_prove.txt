3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
Project Title: SRP Online Store

1. Create new order: A page for customers to create new orders
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/order_detail.php

2. Process orders: A page for administrators to update orders
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/order_process_detail.php

3. Product Management: On this page an administrator can create, update, deactive, search product, supplier, product category, inventory
> Product
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/product_product_detail.php

> Product Category
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/product_category_detail.php

> Product Supplier
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/product_supplier_detail.php

> inventory
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/product_inventory_detail.php

4. Customer Management: On this page an administrator can create, update, deactivate, search customer
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/customer_detail.php

5. User Management: On this page an administrator can create, update, deactivate, search user
https://safe-fjord-79831.herokuapp.com/project1/view/user_detail.php



4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
> No login yet for app users
> No access right configuration
> No prompt when records are successfully/failed created, updated, or deactivated
> No default values. Example status order and processed by should be automatic based on logged in user
> No registration page for customer


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing I learned was injecting JavaScript inside PHP. I know there is a better way to dynamically add
form elements dynamically but I was able to solve the one-to-many challenge for the order and order line relationship
of the project. 

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
First, foreign key constraint helps maintain database referential integrity for example you cannot insert data into the 
parent table without a corresponding record in the child table. Second, it is easier to maintain a well designed database
foreign keys help establish relationships among tables. Third, foreign key constraints help improve performance by including
on how tables are joined.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
CRUD functionality was implemented across the app. Except for the order manaagement page the CRUD functionality is 
uniform across the app.
