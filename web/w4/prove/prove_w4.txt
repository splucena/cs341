After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).
https://github.com/splucena/cs341/blob/master/db/d37erhhggeh672.sql

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
All went completely well. I also created an ENUM for a field with selection like values. 
I tried to make the database pass the 3rd normal form.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
I will expand the product inventory, product measurement, pricelist tables.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing I learned is being able to create database tables using the command line only.

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
Information should be divided into tables. In my case customers, users, orders, products, and suppliers
have their own table. These tables contain information relevant to each table. I have also included
primary keys that will uniquely identify each row that will be inserted in it. I have established and reinforced
relationships between these tables.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I have 9 different tables to support the application I am going to develop. I have normalized the 
database, assigned primary keys, set appropriate data types, and established relationships between the tables.
